#' Two Stage Curvature Identification with Boosting
#' @description \code{tsci_boosting} implements Two Stage Curvature Identification
#' (Guo and Bühlmann 2022) with boosting. Through a data-dependent way, it
#' tests for the smallest sufficiently large violation space among a pre-specified
#' sequence of nested violation space candidates. Point and uncertainty estimates
#' of the treatment effect for all violation space candidates including the
#' selected violation space will be returned amongst other relevant statistics.
#'
#' @param Y observations of the outcome variable. Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by 1.
#' @param D observations of the treatment variable. Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by 1.
#' @param Z observations of the instrumental variable(s). Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by s.
#' @param X observations of baseline covariate(s) used to fit the treatment model. Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by p or \code{NULL}
#' (if no covariates should be included).
#' @param W (transformed) observations of baseline covariate(s) used to fit the outcome model. Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by p_w or \code{NULL}

#' specify the violation space candidates. See Details for more information.
#' @param create_nested_sequence logical. If \code{TRUE}, the violation space candidates (in form of matrices)
#' are defined sequentially starting with an empty violation matrix and subsequently
#' adding the next element of \code{vio_space} to the current violation matrix.
#' If \code{FALSE,} the violation space candidates (in form of matrices) are defined as the empty space and the elements of \code{vio_space}.

#' @param iv_threshold minimal value of the threshold of IV strength test.
#' @param threshold_boot logical. if \code{TRUE}, it determines the threshold of the IV strength using a bootstrap approach.
#' If \code{FALSE}, it does not perform a bootstrap. See Details.
#' @param alpha the significance level.
#' @param nsplits number of times the data will be split. Has to be an integer larger or equal 1. See Details.
#' @param mult_split_method method to calculate the standard errors, p-values and to construct the confidence intervals if multi-splitting is performed.
#' Default is "DML" if \code{nsplits} == 1 and "FWER" otherwise. See Details.
#' @param intercept logical. If \code{TRUE}, an intercept is included in the outcome model.

#'
#' @details The treatment and outcome models are assumed to be of the following forms:
#' \deqn{D_i = f(Z_i, X_i) + \delta_i}
#' \deqn{Y_i = \beta * D_i + h(Z_i, X_i) + \phi(X_i) + \epsilon_i}
#' where \eqn{f(Z_i, X_i)} is estimated using L2 boosting with regression trees as base learners,
#' \eqn{h(Z_i X_i)} is approximated using the violation space candidates and \eqn{\phi(X_i)} is approximated by
#' a linear combination of the columns in \code{W}. The errors are allowed to be heteroscedastic.
#' To avoid overfitting bias the data is randomly split into two subsets \eqn{A1} and \eqn{A2}
#' where the proportion of observations in the two sets is specified by \code{split_prop}.
#' \eqn{A2} is used to train the random forest and \eqn{A1} is used to perform violation space selection
#' and to estimate the treatment effect. \cr \cr
#' The package \code{xgboost} is used for boosting. If any of \code{nrounds},
#' \code{eta}, \code{max_depth}, \code{subsample} or \code{colsample_bytree} has more than one value,
#' the best parameter combination is chosen by minimizing the cross-validation mean squared error. \cr \cr
#' The violation space candidates should be in a nested sequence as the violation space selection is performed
#' by comparing the treatment estimate obtained by each violation space candidate with the estimates of all
#' violation space candidates further down the list \code{vio_space} that provide enough IV strength. Only if no
#' significant difference was found in all of those comparisons, the violation space
#' candidate will be selected. If \code{sel_method} is 'comparison', the treatment effect estimate of this
#' violation space candidate will be returned. If \code{sel_method} is 'conservative', the treatment effect estimate
#' of the successive violation space candidate will be returned provided that the IV strength is large enough.
#' The specification of suitable violation space candidates is a crucial step because a poor approximation
#' of \eqn{g(Z_i, X_i)} might not address the bias caused by the violation of the IV assumption sufficiently well.
#' The function \code{\link[TSML]{create_monomials}} can be used to create a predefined sequence of violation space candidates (monomials).  \cr \cr
#' \code{W} should be chosen to be flexible enough to approximate the functional form of \eqn{\phi} well
#' as otherwise the treatment estimator might be biased. \cr \cr
#' The instrumental variable(s) are considered strong enough for violation space candidate \eqn{V_q} if the estimated IV strength using this
#' violation space candidate is larger than the obtained value of the threshold of the IV strength.
#' The formula of the threshold of the IV strength has the form
#' \eqn{\max \{ 2 \cdot \text{Trace} [ \text{M} (V_q) ], \text{iv{\_}threshold} \} + S (V_q) } if \code{threshold_boot} is \code{TRUE}, and
#' \eqn{\max \{ 2 \cdot \text{Trace} [ \text{M} (V_q) ], \text{iv{\_}threshold} \}} if \code{threshold_boot} is \code{FALSE}. The matrix
#' \eqn{\text{M} (V_q)} depends on the hat matrix obtained from estimating \eqn{f(Z_i, X_i)}, the violation space candidate \eqn{V_q} and
#' the variables to include in the outcome model \code{W}. \eqn{S (V_q)} is obtained using a bootstrap and aims to adjust for the estimation error
#' of the IV strength.
#' Usually, the value of the threshold of the IV strength obtained using the bootstrap approach is larger.
#' Thus, using \code{threshold_boot} equals \code{TRUE} leads to a more conservative IV strength test.
#' For more information see subsection 3.3 in Guo and Bühlmann (2022).\cr \cr
#' \code{nsplits} specifies the number of data splits that should be performed.
#' For each data split the output statistics such as the point estimates of the
#' treatment effect are calculated. Those statistics will then be aggregated
#' over the different data splits. It is recommended to perform multiple data splits
#' as data splitting introduces additional randomness. By aggregating the results
#' of multiple data splits, the effects of this randomness can be decreased.
#' If \code{nsplits} is larger than 1, point estimates are aggregated by medians.
#' Standard errors, p-values and confidence intervals are obtained by the method
#' specified by the parameter \code{mult_split_method}. 'DML' uses the approach by
#' Chernozhukov et al. (2018). 'FWER' uses the approach by Meinshausen et al. (2009)
#' and controls for the family-wise error rate. 'FWER' does not provide standard errors.
#' For large sample sizes, a large values for \code{nsplits} can lead to a high
#' running time as for each split a new hat matrix must be calculated.
