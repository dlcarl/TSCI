#' Two Stage Curvature Identification with User Provided Hat Matrix
#' @description \code{tsci_secondstage} implements Two Stage Curvature Identification
#' (Guo and Buehlmann 2022) for a user-provided hat matrix. Through a data-dependent way it
#' tests for the smallest sufficiently large violation space among a pre-specified
#' sequence of nested violation space candidates. Point and uncertainty estimates
#' of the treatment effect for all violation space candidates including the
#' selected violation space will be returned amongst other relevant statistics.
#'
#' @param Y observations of the outcome variable. Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by 1.
#' @param D observations of the treatment variable. Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by 1.
#' @param Z observations of the instrumental variable(s). Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by s.
#' @param W (transformed) observations of baseline covariate(s) used to fit the outcome model. Either a numeric vector of length n
#' or a numeric matrix with dimension n by p_w or \code{NULL}
#' (if no covariates should be included).
#' @param vio_space  list with numeric vectors of length n and/or numeric matrices with n rows as elements to
#' specify the violation space candidates. See Details for more information.
#' @param create_nested_sequence logical. If \code{TRUE}, the violation space candidates (in form of matrices)
#' are defined sequentially starting with an empty violation matrix and subsequently
#' adding the next element of \code{vio_space} to the current violation matrix.
#' If \code{FALSE,} the violation space candidates (in form of matrices) are defined as the empty space and the elements of \code{vio_space}.
#' See Details for more information.
#' @param weight the hat matrix of the treatment model.
#' @param A1_ind indices of the observations that wil be used to fit the outcome model.
#' Must be of same length as the number of rows and columns of \code{weight}.
#' If \code{NULL}, all observations will be used.
#' @param sel_method The selection method used to estimate the treatment effect. Either "comparison" or "conservative". See Details.
#' @param iv_threshold minimal value of the threshold of IV strength test.
#' @param threshold_boot logical. if \code{TRUE}, it determines the threshold of the IV strength using a bootstrap approach.
#' If \code{FALSE}, it does not perform a bootstrap. See Details.
#' @param alpha the significance level.
#' @param intercept logical. If \code{TRUE}, an intercept is included in the outcome model.
#' @param B number of bootstrap samples.
#' Bootstrap methods are used to calculate the iv strength threshold if \code{threshold_boot} is \code{TRUE} and for the violation space selection.
#'
#' @return
#' A list containing the following elements:
#' \describe{
#'     \item{\code{Coef_all}}{a series of point estimates of the treatment effect
#'     obtained by the different violation space candidates.}
#'     \item{\code{sd_all}}{standard errors of the estimates of the treatmnet effect
#'     obtained by the different violation space candidates.}
#'     \item{\code{pval_all}}{p-values of the treatment effect estimates obtained by the
#'     different violation space candidates.}
#'     \item{\code{CI_all}}{confidence intervals for the treatment effect obtained by the
#'     different violation space candidates.}
#'     \item{\code{Coef_sel}}{the point estimator of the treatment effect obtained by
#'     the selected violation space candidate(s).}
#'     \item{\code{sd_sel}}{the standard error of Coef_sel.}
#'     \item{\code{pval_sel}}{p-value of the treatment effect estimate obtained by the
#'     selected violation space candidate(s).}
#'     \item{\code{CI_sel}}{confidence interval for the treatment effect obtained by
#'     the selected violation space candidate(s).}
#'     \item{\code{iv_str}}{IV strength using the different violation space candidates.}
#'     \item{\code{iv_thol}}{the threshold for the IV strength using the different violation space candidates.}
#'     \item{\code{Qmax}}{the violation space candidate that was the largest violation space candidate
#'     for which the IV strength was considered large enough determined by the IV strength test.
#'     If 0, the IV Strength test failed for the first violation space candidate.
#'     Otherwise, violation space selection was performed.}
#'     \item{\code{q_comp}}{the violation space candidate that was selected by the comparison method over the multiple data splits.}
#'     \item{\code{q_cons}}{the violation space candidate that was selected by the conservative method over the multiple data splits.}
#'     \item{\code{invalidity}}{shows whether the instrumental variable(s) were considered valid, invalid or too weak to test for violations.
#'     The instrumental variables are considered too weak to test for violations if the IV strength is already too weak using the first
#'     violation space candidate (besides the empty violation space). Testing for violations is always performed by using the comparison method.}

#'
#' @details The treatment and outcome models are assumed to be of the following forms:
#' \deqn{D_i = f(Z_i, X_i) + \delta_i}
#' \deqn{Y_i = \beta \cdot D_i + h(Z_i, X_i) + \phi(X_i) + \epsilon_i}
#' where \eqn{f(Z_i, X_i)} is estimated using a random forest,
#' \eqn{h(Z_i X_i)} is approximated using the hat matrix \code{weight} provided by the user and
#' \eqn{\phi(X_i)} is approximated by a linear combination of the columns in \code{W}.
#' The errors are allowed to be heteroscedastic. \eqn{A1} is used to perform violation space selection
#' and to estimate the treatment effect. \cr \cr
#' The violation space candidates should be in a nested sequence as the violation space selection is performed
#' by comparing the treatment estimate obtained by each violation space candidate with the estimates of all
#' violation space candidates further down the list \code{vio_space} that provide enough IV strength. Only if no
#' significant difference was found in all of those comparisons, the violation space
#' candidate will be selected. If \code{sel_method} is 'comparison', the treatment effect estimate of this
#' violation space candidate will be returned. If \code{sel_method} is 'conservative', the treatment effect estimate
#' of the successive violation space candidate will be returned provided that the IV strength is large enough.
#' The specification of suitable violation space candidates is a crucial step because a poor approximation
#' of \eqn{g(Z_i, X_i)} might not address the bias caused by the violation of the IV assumption sufficiently well.
#' The function \code{\link[TSCI]{create_monomials}} can be used to create a predefined sequence of
#' violation space candidates consisting of monomials.
#' The function \code{\link[TSCI]{create_interactions}} can be used to create a predefined sequence of
#' violation space candidates consisting of two-way interactions between the instrumens themselves and between
#' the instruments and the instruments and baseline covariates.  \cr \cr
#' The instrumental variable(s) are considered strong enough for violation space candidate \eqn{V_q} if the estimated IV strength using this
#' violation space candidate is larger than the obtained value of the threshold of the IV strength.
#' The formula of the threshold of the IV strength has the form
#' \eqn{\max \{ 2 \cdot \mathrm{Trace} [ \mathrm{M} (V_q) ], \mathrm{iv{\_}threshold} \} + S (V_q) } if \code{threshold_boot} is \code{TRUE}, and
#' \eqn{\max \{ 2 \cdot \mathrm{Trace} [ \mathrm{M} (V_q) ], \mathrm{iv{\_}threshold} \}} if \code{threshold_boot} is \code{FALSE}. The matrix
#' \eqn{\mathrm{M} (V_q)} depends on the hat matrix obtained from estimating \eqn{f(Z_i, X_i)}, the violation space candidate \eqn{V_q} and
#' the variables to include in the outcome model \code{W}. \eqn{S (V_q)} is obtained using a bootstrap and aims to adjust for the estimation error
#' of the IV strength.
#' Usually, the value of the threshold of the IV strength obtained using the bootstrap approach is larger.
#' Thus, using \code{threshold_boot} equals \code{TRUE} leads to a more conservative IV strength test.
