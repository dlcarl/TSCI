Description: Two stage curvature identification with machine learning for causal 
    inference in settings when instrumental variable regression is not suitable
    because of potentially invalid instrumental variables. Based on Guo and 
    BÃ¼hlmann (2022) "Two Stage Curvature Identification with Machine Learning: 
    Causal Inference with Possibly Invalid Instrumental Variables"
