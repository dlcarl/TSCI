Description: Two stage curvature identification with machine learning for causal 
    inference in settings when instrumental variable regression is not suitable
    because of potentially invalid instrumental variables. Based on Guo and 
    Buehlmann (2022) "Two Stage Curvature Identification with Machine Learning: 
    Causal Inference with Possibly Invalid Instrumental Variables"
    <arXiv:2203.12808> .
